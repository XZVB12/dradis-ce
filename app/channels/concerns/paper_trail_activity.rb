# This module exists to assist with PaperTrail::Version properties in Channels.
# Typically the controllers take care of this but this request process does not
# utilize controllers. In controllers we set PaperTrail metadata in
# ProjectScoped#info_for_paper_trail. For channels we will do it here as a
# before_subscribe action.
